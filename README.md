# Sudoku

## Setup

First of all, you can clone the repository by running :

    git clone https://github.com/BeedleForTest/Sudoku.git

To run it, you can either decide to use a virtual env or not. I'll cover this option.

    cd Sudoku
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows Users) || source venv/bin/activate (for Ubuntu Users)
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run

Eventually, you can simply run it with `python app.py`. Virtual environment should be activated first of course. The server runs on port 5000.
